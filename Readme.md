# DROIDS
Directly Recognize the Opponent Intrusion Detection System

This is an IDS specificly designed for a Capture-The-Flag event. It analyzes
tcp and udp conversations to create a baseline of permitted conversations.

Then, during the challenge phase, it detects conversations that don't fit in the
baseline. This lets you quickly find the attacks that others are using on your
server.
